[pytest]
# Pytest configuration for Cart API automation project
#
# Purpose:
# Centralized configuration to keep test execution deterministic,
# CI-friendly, and easy to reason about during failures.
#
# Strategy:
# - Tests are grouped by intent using explicit markers
# - CI relies on clear signals, not broad test retries
# - Each marker represents a different risk category

testpaths = src
addopts = -ra

markers =
    contract: API contract tests validating external dependency schemas and required fields
    negative: Negative and error-handling scenarios validating safe failure behavior
    e2e_smoke: Minimal end-to-end smoke tests for critical user-facing flows only
